## Deposit Function in StackingDAO Contract

The deposit function allows users to deposit STX in exchange for stSTX tokens. Here's a detailed look at its operations:

<CH.Slideshow>

**Determine Current Cycle**

Fetches the current PoX cycle and retrieves its information.

```clarity focus=4:6
(define-public (deposit (reserve-contract <reserve-trait>) (stx-amount uint) (referrer (optional principal)))
  (let
    (
      (cycle-id (get-pox-cycle))
      (current-cycle-info (get-cycle-info cycle-id))

      (stx-ststx (try! (get-stx-per-ststx reserve-contract)))
      (ststx-to-receive (/ (* stx-amount u1000000) stx-ststx))
    )
    (try! (contract-call? .dao check-is-enabled))
    (asserts! (not (get-shutdown-deposits)) (err ERR_SHUTDOWN))

    (map-set cycle-info { cycle-id: cycle-id } (merge current-cycle-info { deposited: (+ (get deposited current-cycle-info) stx-amount) }))
    (print { action: "deposit", data: { stacker: tx-sender, referrer: referrer, amount: ststx-to-receive, block-height: block-height } })

    (try! (stx-transfer? stx-amount tx-sender (contract-of reserve-contract)))
    (try! (contract-call? .ststx-token mint-for-protocol ststx-to-receive tx-sender))

    (ok ststx-to-receive)
  )
)
```

**Calculate stSTX to Receive**

Calculates the amount of stSTX tokens the user will receive based on the current conversion rate.

```clarity focus=7:8
  
```

---

**Check Contract State**

Ensures the DAO is enabled and deposits are not shut down.

```clarity focus=9:11
  
```

---

**Update Cycle Information**

Updates the cycle's deposited amount to include the new deposit and log the deposit details.

```clarity focus=12:14
  
```

---

**Transfer STX and Mint stSTX**

Transfers the STX to the reserve contract and mints stSTX for the user.

```clarity focus=16:17
  
```
