> **Note:** This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of post conditions in Stacks transactions. If you're new to post conditions, we recommend reading the [Intro to Post Conditions](./intro-to-post-conditions.mdx) before proceeding.

## Overview of Post Conditions

Post conditions in Stacks transactions come in various flavors, each serving a unique purpose and requiring different arguments. Here's a quick rundown:

1. [**STX Post Conditions**](#stx-post-conditions): These involve the transfer of STX tokens. They can be standard or contract-based.
2. **Fungible Token Post Conditions**: These deal with fungible tokens (identical and interchangeable), like an ERC-20 token in Ethereum.
3. **NFT Post Conditions**: These are about non-fungible tokens (unique), similar to ERC-721 tokens in Ethereum.

Remember, the devil is in the details. So, let's dive in! 

## STX Post Conditions

<CH.Section>

To create a STX post condition, use [`makeStandardSTXPostCondition`](focus://3,10:14).

The arguments are:

-  [`address`](focus://6,11): this is the address of the sending principal (the address that will be sending the STX)
-  [`conditionCode`](focus://2,7,12): this is the condition, represented by an integer, that must be met for the transaction to be valid.
-  [`amount`](focus://8,13): the amount of STX to be sent (represented in uSTX)

```typescript
import {
  FungibleConditionCode,
  makeStandardSTXPostCondition,
} from "@stacks/transactions";

const address = "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM";
// link[23:43] #fungibleconditioncode
const conditionCode = FungibleConditionCode.Equal;
const amount = 42000000; // 42 STX
const postConditions = [
  makeStandardSTXPostCondition(
    address,
    conditionCode,
    amount
  ),
];
```

</CH.Section>

Once you have a Post-Condition setup, you can introduce it into your transaction by using `makeSTXTokenTransfer` or `makeContractCall`.

### Use with `makeSTXTokenTransfer`

You can use post conditions with `makeSTXTokenTransfer` by passing the `postConditions` array as an argument.

```typescript
import { makeSTXTokenTransfer, broadcastTransaction, AnchorMode } from '@stacks/transactions';

const txOptions = {
  recipient: 'ST2ST2H80NP5C9SPR4ENJ1Z9CDM9PKAJVPYWPQZ50',
  ...
  postConditions: postConditions,
};

const transaction = await makeSTXTokenTransfer(txOptions);
const broadcastResponse = await broadcastTransaction(transaction);
const txId = broadcastResponse.txid;
```

### Use with `makeContractCall`

You can use post conditions with `makeContractCall` - when interacting with a smart contract - by passing the `postConditions` array as an argument.

For this example, let's assume we have a smart contract called `vault` that has a function called `send-stx` that takes a `principal` and `uint` as an argument.

```typescript
import {
  makeContractCall,
  broadcastTransaction,
  principalCV,
  uintCV,
  AnchorMode
} from '@stacks/transactions';

// Define the recipient's address in Clarity Value format
const to = principalCV("ST2ST2H80NP5C9SPR4ENJ1Z9CDM9PKAJVPYWPQZ50");

// Define the amount to be transferred in Clarity Value format
const amount = uintCV(42000000);

// Define the network to be used, in this case, it's the Stacks Devnet
const network = new StacksDevnet();

 const txOptions = {
  contractAddress: 'ST2ST2H80NP5C9SPR4ENJ1Z9CDM9PKAJVPYWPQZ50'
  contractName: 'vault',
  functionName: 'send-stx',
  functionArgs: [to, amount],
  senderKey,
  network,
  postConditions,
  anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,
};

const transaction = await makeContractCall(txOptions);
const broadcastResponse = await broadcastTransaction(transaction);
const txId = broadcastResponse.txid;
```
