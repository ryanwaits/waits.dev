While awesome libraries exist like [Micro Stacks](https://micro-stacks.dev/) and [Stacks.js](https://www.hiro.so/stacks-js) for interacting directly with the Stacks blockchain, some developers work primarily on a subset of smart contracts such as BNS, pox, ExecutorDAO, and others.

In this scenario, establishing a UI standard for interacting with those contracts could greatly speed up the development workflow as well as contribute to creating a more decentralized ecosystem.

*Enter Second Layer...*

## What is Second Layer?

Second Layer is a low-code UI library for interacting with native smart contracts on Stacks.

At its core, Second Layer simplifies the process of integrating and working with smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It eliminates the need for complex and time-consuming UI work and allows you to focus on the core functionalities of your application.

One key advantage is the seamless integration with popular frameworks like Radix UI, TailwindCSS, and Micro Stacks Library.

Flexibility and customization are usually where UI components fail, but we built Second Layer with two main points of emphasis:
- Ensure compatibility with existing development ecosystems
- Configurable enough to match any project's branding and design

## How do I use Second Layer?

Luckily, we've packaged the components into a library that you can easily import into your frontend projects:

```bash
npm install '@secondlayer/components'
```

### Example: Voting on a proposal

There are several applications on Stacks that require some sort of voting/approval process.

Typically the way this goes down is the community has to follow a long list of instructions through a forum post or some Discord channel that requires making transaction calls via the Stacks Explorer.

For non-technical people (heck even technical people) this can often times be confusing and a pain.

With Second Layer, developers can spin up an app with just 10 lines of code:

```jsx showLineNumbers title="App.tsx"
import { Proposal } from '@secondlayer/components'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Proposal.View
    	address='SPKPXQ0X3A4D1KZ4XTP1GABJX1N36VW10D02TK9X.mega-voting'
    	proposalId='SP2F40S465JTD7AMZ2X9SMN229617HZ9YB0HHY98A.MDP-010'
    />
  )
};
```

And users can now interact with this:

Ultimately, Second Layer aims to make your development journey smoother, faster, and more enjoyable while contributing to a more resilient ecosystem of applications on Stacks.

In the next few months, we plan to roll out several more use cases such as Stacking and managing BNS.

We also plan to create templates using our UI components so that non-technical community members can deploy their own applications with just a few clicks.
