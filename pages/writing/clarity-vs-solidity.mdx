## Variable Declaration and Mutability

<CH.Slideshow>

In Solidity, variables are `mutable` by default and can be updated directly within functions.

```solidity focus=2,5
contract User {
  uint public userAge = 42;

  function updateAge(uint newAge) public {
    // mark
    userAge = newAge;
  }
}
```

---

...unless explicitly declared as `constant`.

```solidity focus=2,5 mark=2[15:22]
contract User {
  uint public constant USER_AGE = 42;

  function updateAge(uint newAge) public {
    // mark
    USER_AGE = newAge; // ❌ Compilation Error
  }
}
```

---

...or `immutable`.

```solidity focus=2,5 mark=2[15:23]
contract User {
  uint public immutable USER_AGE = 42;

  function updateAge(uint newAge) public {
    // mark
    USER_AGE = newAge; // ❌ Compilation Error
  }
}
```

---

Clarity emphasizes *deliberate* state changes and requires *explicity actions* to mutate variables.

```clarity focus=1,5
(define-data-var userAge uint u42)

(define-public (update-age (newAge uint))
  (begin
    // mark
    (var-set userAge newAge)
    (ok newAge)
  )
)
```

---

Similar to Solidity, Clarity offers a `define-constant` function to declare immutable variables.

```clarity focus=1,4
(define-constant USER_AGE u42)

(define-public (update-age (newAge uint))
  (var-set USER_AGE newAge) ;; ❌ Expecting a data-var
  (ok USER_AGE)
)
```

---

Clarity enforces a strict and explicit approach to state management compared to Solidity. In Clarity, variables that are meant to be mutable must be explicitly declared as such using `define-data-var`, and their values can only be updated using specific functions like `var-set`.

```clarity focus=1,4
(define-constant USER_AGE u42)

(define-public (update-age (newAge uint))
  USER_AGE = newAge ;; ❌ Invalid syntax
  (ok USER_AGE)
)
```

</CH.Slideshow>

## Structs, Tuples, and Maps

<CH.Slideshow>

Solidity uses structs to define custom data types that can group together several variables.

```solidity focus=2:5
contract UserContract {
  struct User {
    string name;
    uint age;
  }

  User public user = User("Ryan", 42);

  function updateUser(string memory newName, uint newAge) public {
    user.name = newName;
    user.age = newAge;
  }
}
```

---

Structs in Solidity can be mutable, and their fields can be updated after creation.

```solidity focus=6:7
contract UserContract {
  struct User {
    string name;
    uint age;
  }

  // mark
  User public user = User("Ryan", 42);

  function updateUser(string memory newName, uint newAge) public {
    user.name = newName;
    user.age = newAge;
  }
}
```

---

Clarity supports tuples, which are immutable collections of data that group together multiple fields.

```clarity focus=1 mark=1
(define-constant user (tuple (name "Ryan") (age 42)))

(let
  (
    (userName (get name user))
    (userAge (get age user))
  )
  (print { userName: userName, userAge: userAge } )
)
```

---

...you can also use bracket syntax to define `tuples`.

```clarity focus=1 mark=1
(define-constant user { name: "Ryan", age: 42 })

(let
  (
    (userName (get name user))
    (userAge (get age user))
  )
  (print { userName: userName, userAge: userAge } )
)
```

---

Clarity also allows for dynamic collections of data (including `tuples`) through the use of maps. Maps can store key-value pairs, where keys are unique identifiers and values are tuples. This enables the creation of dynamic, updatable collections of structured data.

```clarity focus=1,4 mark=4[25:63]
(define-map users uint (tuple (name (string-ascii 50)) (age uint)))

(define-public (add-or-update-user (userId uint) (userName (string-ascii 50)) (userAge uint))
  (map-set users userId (tuple (name userName) (age userAge)))
  (ok true)
)
```

---

...using bracket syntax.

```clarity focus=1,4 mark=4[25:56]
(define-map users uint { name: (string-ascii 50), age: uint })

(define-public (add-or-update-user (userId uint) (userName (string-ascii 50)) (userAge uint))
  (map-set users userId { name: userName, age: userAge })
  (ok true)
)
```

## Functions, Modifiers and State Mutability

<CH.Slideshow>

Solidity uses function modifiers to indicate whether a function can modify the state.

```solidity focus=4[27:33],8[28:32],12[32:37]
contract UserManagement {
  uint private age;

  function incrementAge() private {
    age += 1;
  }

  function getAge() public view returns (uint) {
    return age;
  }

  function setAge(uint newAge) public {
    age = newAge;
    incrementAge();
  }
}
```

---

The `incrementAge` function is marked as `private` and can only be called from within the contract.

```solidity focus=4[27:33],14
contract UserManagement {
  uint private age;

  function incrementAge() private {
    age += 1;
  }

  function getAge() public view returns (uint) {
    return age;
  }

  function setAge(uint newAge) public {
    age = newAge;
    incrementAge();
  }
}
```

---

Clarity does not have modifiers in the same way Solidity does. Instead, state mutability is determined by the built-in functions used.

```clarity focus=3[2:15],7[2:17],11[2:15]
(define-data-var userAge uint u0)

(define-private (increment-age)
  (var-set userAge (+ (var-get userAge) u1))
)

(define-read-only (get-user-age)
  (var-get userAge)
)

(define-public (set-user-age (newAge uint))
  (var-set userAge newAge)
  (ok newAge)
)
```

---

`define-private` functions are used to define private functions that can only be called from within the contract.

```clarity focus=3:5
(define-data-var userAge uint u0)

(define-private (increment-age)
  (var-set userAge (+ (var-get userAge) u1))
)

(define-read-only (get-user-age)
  (var-get userAge)
)

(define-public (set-user-age (newAge uint))
  (var-set userAge newAge)
  (ok newAge)
)
```

---

`define-read-only` functions are used to define functions that can only read from the contract's state.

```clarity focus=7:9
(define-data-var userAge uint u0)

(define-private (increment-age)
  (var-set userAge (+ (var-get userAge) u1))
)

(define-read-only (get-user-age)
  (var-get userAge)
)

(define-public (set-user-age (newAge uint))
  (var-set userAge newAge)
  (ok newAge)
)
```

---

`define-public` functions are used to define functions that can be called from outside the contract.

```clarity focus=11:14
(define-data-var userAge uint u0)

(define-private (increment-age)
  (var-set userAge (+ (var-get userAge) u1))
)

(define-read-only (get-user-age)
  (var-get userAge)
)

(define-public (set-user-age (newAge uint))
  (var-set userAge newAge)
  (ok newAge)
)
```

</CH.Slideshow>

## Calling functions

<CH.Slideshow>

In Solidity, functions can be called internally within the contract or `externally` by other contracts and transactions.

```solidity focus=1:7,12
contract UserManagement {
  uint public age;

  function setAge(uint newAge) public {
    age = newAge;
  }
}

contract Caller {
  function callSetAge(address userManagementAddress, uint newAge) public {
    UserManagement userManagement = UserManagement(userManagementAddress);
    // mark
    userManagement.setAge(newAge);
  }
}
```

---

In Clarity, functions can be called internally within the contract or `externally` by other contracts and transactions.

```clarity focus=1:7,12
(define-data-var age uint u20)

(define-private (increment-age)
  (var-set age (+ (var-get age) u1))
)

(define-public (update-age)
  (increment-age) ;; Internal call
  (ok (var-get age))
)
```

---

...you can also use the `contract-call` function to call functions from other contracts.

```clarity focus=1:7,12
(define-data-var age uint u20)

(define-private (increment-age)
  (var-set age (+ (var-get age) u1))
)

(define-public (update-age)
  (increment-age) ;; Internal call
  (ok (var-get age))
)

(define-public (call-set-age (contractA principal) (newAge uint))
  (contract-call? contractA set-age newAge)
)
```

</CH.Slideshow>

## Events and Logs

<CH.Slideshow>

In Solidity, events are declared using the `event` keyword. You can then `emit` your event inside a function to log it.

```solidity focus=2,5
contract UserManagement {
  event UserUpdated(string name, uint age);

  function updateUser(string memory _name, uint _age) public {
    emit UserUpdated(_name, _age);
  }
}
```

---

Clarity does not have events in the same way Solidity does. Instead, it uses a logging mechanism through the print function, which outputs information that can be indexed and accessed by external observers.

```clarity focus=2
(define-public (update-user (name (string-ascii 32)) (age uint))
  (print { action: "User updated", name: name, age: age })
  (ok true)
)
```

---

...some native, built-in functions also emit events automatically.

```clarity focus=2
(define-public (update-user (name (string-ascii 32)) (age uint))
  // mark
  (stx-transfer? amount tx-sender recipient)
  (ok true)
)
```

</CH.Slideshow>

## Access Control

<CH.Slideshow>

Solidity allows for the creation of custom modifiers to control access to functions. The `onlyOwner` modifier is a common pattern used to restrict function execution to the contract's owner.

```solidity focus=7:11,13[49:59],14
contract Owned {
  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _;
  }

  function changeOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    owner = newOwner;
  }
}
```

---

...you can also just use `require` statements directly to control access to functions.

```solidity focus=9
contract Owned {
  address public owner;

  constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    // mark
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    owner = newOwner;
  }
}
```

---

Clarity does not have modifiers in the same way Solidity does. Instead, access control can be implemented through explicit checks within functions.

```clarity focus=5
(define-data-var owner principal tx-sender)

(define-public (change-owner (newOwner principal))
  (begin
    // mark
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender (var-get owner)) (err u1))
    (var-set owner newOwner)
    (ok true)
  )
)
```

</CH.Slideshow>

## Practical Examples

### Transferring Native Tokens

<CH.Slideshow>

To send ETH, you would typically use the `transfer` or `send` method from an address.

```solidity focus=3
contract SendETH {
  function sendViaTransfer(address payable _to) public payable {
    // mark
    _to.transfer(msg.value);
  }
}
```

---

Notice that the `sendViaTransfer` function is marked as `payable` to allow it to send and receive ETH. The `_to` address is also marked as `payable` to allow it to receive ETH.

```solidity focus=2[36:42,56:63]
contract SendETH {
  function sendViaTransfer(address payable _to) public payable {
    // mark
    _to.transfer(msg.value);
  }
}
```

---

In Clarity, sending STX involves calling the built-in function `stx-transfer`. The function inherently checks if the transaction sender has enough STX and if the transfer is possible, making the code straightforward.

```clarity focus=2
(define-public (send-stx (recipient principal) (amount uint))
  // mark
  (stx-transfer? amount tx-sender recipient)
)
```

</CH.Slideshow>

### Transferring Fungible Tokens

<CH.Slideshow>

Transferring an ERC20 token in Solidity involves calling the transfer function of the token's contract:

```solidity focus=8
interface IERC20 {
  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract SendERC20 {
  function transferToken(address _tokenContract, address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
    IERC20 tokenContract = IERC20(_tokenContract);
    // mark
    tokenContract.transfer(_to, _amount);
  }
}
```

---

In Clarity, transferring a SIP-010 standard fungible token can be done by calling the transfer function defined in the token's contract:

```clarity focus=2
(define-public (transfer-token (recipient principal) (amount uint))
  // mark
  (contract-call? .token transfer amount tx-sender recipient)
)
```

</CH.Slideshow>

### Transferring Non-Fungible Tokens

<CH.Slideshow>

Transferring an ERC721 token (NFT) in Solidity is done using the transferFrom function:

```solidity focus=8
interface IERC721 {
  function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;
}

contract SendERC721 {
  function transferNFT(address _nftContract, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public {
    IERC721 nftContract = IERC721(_nftContract);
    // mark
    nftContract.transferFrom(msg.sender, _to, _tokenId);
  }
}
```

---

Transferring a SIP-009 standard NFT in Clarity involves calling the transfer function of the NFT's contract:

```clarity
(define-public (transfer-nft (nft-contract principal) (token-id uint) (recipient principal))
  // mark
  (contract-call? nft-contract transfer token-id tx-sender recipient)
)
```
